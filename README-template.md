## My process

### Built with


**HTML/CSS & JS best practices:** Correct use of tags, elements, properties and syntax.

**GitHub flow:** Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development.


### Continued Development

This project is continuously evolving, and the following improvements and features are planned for future releases:

#### Custom Calculation Logic:
- **Custom Logic Implementation**: In future updates, the calculator will be refactored to implement custom logic for performing calculations, completely eliminating the reliance on a traditional JavaScript calculator function. This will involve building the mathematical operations from scratch using algorithms and formulas to handle user input and perform calculations.
  
- **Enhanced Algorithm**: The new custom logic will ensure better precision, handle more complex mathematical operations, and provide the ability to add advanced functions (e.g., trigonometric, logarithmic, etc.) without relying on external JavaScript libraries.
  
#### Planned Features:
- **Scientific Calculator**: Add advanced features like square roots, exponents, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, etc.), and logarithms to extend the calculator‚Äôs functionality.
- **History Tracking**: Implement a history feature that stores previous calculations, allowing users to easily recall and reuse past results.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Add support for multiple languages to make the calculator accessible to a global audience.
- **Voice Input**: Integrate voice recognition technology so users can input calculations using voice commands.
  
#### Improvements:
- **Performance Optimization**: Refactor the code for faster processing, especially as more complex logic is integrated into the calculator.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Continuously improve the UI for a more polished experience, ensuring smooth animations, transitions, and visual feedback on every action.
  
#### Bugs to Fix:
- **Edge Case Handling**: Improve the handling of edge cases, such as dividing by zero, input errors, or invalid characters.
  
#### Contribution Opportunities:
If you'd like to contribute to the development of the calculator, help with implementing custom logic, or contribute to any of the above features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
